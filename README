Unless specified differently in the individual code file,
assume all code in this project is licensed under GPLv3

My intention is to assume the same license as the Debian package:
	http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/chiark-utils-bin

so as, if these scripts do ever cleaned up and in a reasonable
state, that they may be considered for inclusion as a contrib/
to /usr/bin/summer as it is that output format which was used
as the first test of these scripts.

Initial push will be unclean (but mostly working) code.

I primarily use Debian GNU/Linux and intend to rework things
into a cleaner form once Python 3 is the default in my main
work enviroment (Debian)
